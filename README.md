# FFmpeg Quality Metrics

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ffmpeg_quality_metrics.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ffmpeg_quality_metrics)

Simple script for calculating quality metrics with FFmpeg.

Currently supports PSNR, SSIM and VMAF. It will output:

- the per-frame metrics
- metrics for each component (Y, U, V)
- global statistics (min/max/average/standard deviation)

------

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FFmpeg:
    - **Linux:** Download the git master build from [here](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/). Installation instructions, as well as how to add FFmpeg and FFprobe to your PATH, can be found [here](https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/faq/).
    - **macOS:** Download the *snapshot* build from [here](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/).
    - **Windows:** Download an FFmpeg binary from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). The `git essentials` build will suffice. 

Put the `ffmpeg` executable in your `$PATH`.

*FFmpeg can be installed using Homebrew, but it is recommended that you use one of the FFmpeg builds linked above, otherwise libvmaf <v2.0.0 will be used, which is ~2x slower ([source](https://netflixtechblog.com/toward-a-better-quality-metric-for-the-video-community-7ed94e752a30)).*

## Installation

    pip3 install ffmpeg_quality_metrics

Or clone this repository, then run the tool with `python3 -m ffmpeg_quality_metrics`

## Usage

In the simplest case, if you have a distorted (encoded, maybe scaled) version and the reference:

```
ffmpeg_quality_metrics distorted.mp4 reference.avi
```

The distorted file will be automatically scaled to the resolution of the reference.

### Extended Options

See `ffmpeg_quality_metrics -h`:

```
usage: [-h] [-n] [-v] [-ev] [-m MODEL_PATH] [-p] [-dp]
       [-s {fast_bilinear,bilinear,bicubic,experimental,neighbor,area,bicublin,gauss,sinc lanczos,spline}]
       [-of {json,csv}] [-r FRAMERATE] [-t THREADS] [-nt N_THREADS]
       dist ref
                   
positional arguments:
  dist                  input file, distorted
  ref                   input file, reference

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --dry-run         Do not run command, just show what would be done (default: False)
  -v, --verbose         Show verbose output (default: False)
  -ev, --enable-vmaf    Enable VMAF computation; calculates VMAF as well as SSIM and PSNR (default: False)
  -m MODEL_PATH, --model-path MODEL_PATH
                        Specify the path of the VMAF model file (default: None)
  -p, --phone-model     Enable VMAF phone model (default: False)
  -dp, --disable-psnr-ssim
                        Disable PSNR/SSIM computation. Use VMAF to get YUV estimate. (default: False)
  -s {fast_bilinear,bilinear,bicubic,experimental,neighbor,area,bicublin,gauss,sinc,lanczos,spline}, --scaling-algorithm {fast_bilinear,bilinear,bicubic,experimental,neighbor,area,bicublin,gauss,sinc,lanczos,spline}
                        Scaling algorithm for ffmpeg (default: bicubic)
  -of {json,csv}, --output-format {json,csv}
                        Output format for the metrics (default: json)
  -r FRAMERATE, --framerate FRAMERATE
                        Force an input framerate (default: None)
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to do the calculations (default: 0)
  -nt N_THREADS, --n-threads N_THREADS
                        Set the value of libvmaf's n_threads option. This determines the number of threads that are used for VMAF calculation
```

### Specifying VMAF Model

Use the `-m/--model-path` option to set the path to the model file.

For example, if you have the model file saved at:

```
/usr/local/opt/libvmaf/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.json
```

Run the command with:

```
ffmpeg_quality_metrics dist.mkv ref.mkv -m /usr/local/opt/libvmaf/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.json
```

## Running with Docker

If you don't want to deal with dependencies, build the image with Docker:

```
docker build -t ffmpeg_quality_metrics .
```

This installs `ffmpeg` with all dependencies. You can then run the container, which basically calls the Python script. To help you with mounting the volumes (since your videos are not stored in the container), you can run a helper script:

```
./docker_run.sh
```

Check the output of the above command for more help.

## Output

JSON or CSV, including individual fields for Y, U, V, and averages, as well as frame numbers.
